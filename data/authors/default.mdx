Writing code like crafting haiku.
Walking mountain trails like folding origami.
In a world that speaks in noise, I answer with stillness.

I’m not here to shout—I’m here to build, write, grow.
Small things, meaningful things. Things that stay.

Sometimes I work with Java.
Sometimes I work with shadows.

Welcome to the quiet end of the web.
